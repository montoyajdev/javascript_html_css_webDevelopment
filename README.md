>Navigation Bar
I created a navigation bar that appears when the user scrolls up and disappears when the user scrolls down. 
One navigation bar would appear for screen sizes that were greater than 768 pixels and another navigation bar would appear for screen sizes less than 767 pixels.  

>AnimationsAnimations appeared depending how close the user scrolled to the animation.

>Instgram API
I created an Instagram API so that my posts on Instagram were synchronized and shown on my website in real-time.
